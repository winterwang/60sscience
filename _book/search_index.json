And it turns out, a bumblebee , might have a similar feeling, buzzing through a field of flowers. So these flowers , are these build balls of billboards, they’re advertising are good. It’s a good, this delicious nectar to the worldreward, and bees are very picky shoppers. Anne Leonard, a pollination biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. She describes the a flower field as a sort of pollination marketplace. And one way , bees choose where to visit. ? Bees are nectar experts. They are really good at assessing even really small differences , in like sugar concentration of nectar. They also scope out the shape and size of flowers and their color and scent. And now Leonard and her colleagues have discovered that bumblebees are pollen aficionados, too. They found out that out by lacing batches of cherry pollen with either table sugar or bitter quinine. And they to display the pollen to bees. , we got really into it , - we set up a started 3-D printing flowers in our lab. And for the answer, anther - the male flower part, which presents the pollen - pipe cleaners. So we’ve we bought out Michael’s craft store’s store supplies of these pipe cleaners and used them in our experiments. It Turns out that bees will would return again and again to the same colored color flower that dispenses dispensed sweet pollen, and spent spend more time collecting there. But when confronted with the bitter pollen? They sought a different color colored flower for the their very next stop. All of which suggest suggests that, in addition to savor in savoring nectar, bees taste pollen too - and judge flowers by it. The results are in the journal Biology Letters. The finding means that plants have to find a happy medium. : So can you make your pollen attractive enough , that the bees will collect it, but distasteful stuff enough that they won’t collect too much of it. ? And that balancing act, of carefully collaborative calibrated chemistry is - it’s just one of the many transactions that plays out in a the buzzing pollination marketmarketplace.

Well, your bacteria may share some of the blame. Because a new study in mice shows that the responsive response of intestinal microbes to a high-fat diet ends up triggering the release of a hormone that makes mammals feel hungry, causing them to eat even more. The finding is served up in the journal Nature. Previous work had has shown that the types of bacteria in the gut in diabetic or obese individuals are different from the bacteria in healthy people. But does these bacteria make a this bacterial makeup contribute to these disorders, ? Or is it just a side effect? To unravel this mystery, researchers put mice on a high-fat diet. The animals experienced to built a buildup of a chemical called acetate, particularly in the large intestine. That location points to gut bacteria, which can produce acetate, as a possible culprit. So the researchers wiped out the microbes using antibiotics or a simple saline wash. And acetate levels plummeted. Okay, so the gut bacteria in fat-fed mice make acetate. What does acetate do? Well, it gets the involuntary part of the nerve nervous system, the parasympathetic nerve nervous system. , to put out the call to produce more insulin. Unfortunately, in this case, acetate also gets the parasympathetic nerve nervous system to stimulate the production of a hunger hormone called ghrelin. And the more fat fats an animal consumes, the more acetate it makes . - which means the more ghrelin it produces , and, of course, the more it eats. And bacteria make the whole sequence happen. The researchers are now investigating , whether the same biochemical events happen in humans. If they do, it’s possible that obtaining a better assortment assortments of gut bacteria could help us control our weight. Of course, the best way to get those good bacteria is from a fecal transplant . - in which bacteria-rich feces come out of one person and into you.

That’s mathematician David Hand, talking about his 2014 book , The Improbability Principle: Why Coincidences, Miracles and Rare Events Happen Every Day. The law of inevitability comes into play in the lottery drawings . - some set of the numbers will be drawn, so a potential winning combination is inevitable. The key word being “ potential” , as nobody has yet won the multistate Powerball lottery. Which means that the jackpot for the next drawing, the night of January 13th, is up to some $1. 3 billion. You could buy a ticket and hope, . Or, as you may have amusedmused, you could buy every possible set of numbers to inevitably win. In 1992, Virginia State Lottery. , the Virginia State Lottery is a six/44 lottery . - you have to choose six numbers out of 44 , - which means it’s a one in seven million chance that a ticket, particular ticket , to will be the Jackpot winning jackpot-winning ticket. Seven million. So if you bought all the tickets, it will would only cost you $7 million. Stay So they waited until the roll of rollover jackpot to had built up to, haven’t hadn’t been won, to so it built up over several weeks to $27 million. If you managed manage to spend $7 milllion million and buy all the seven million tickets , you are guaranteed to hold the jackpot winning ticket. But there is there’s a lot of organizations organization involved in this. In fact, what happened , was they put together a consortium of 2 and a half thousand 2,500 people. , each of whom pays paid $3000, so there are about3,000 or thereabouts, so they have had $7 million. And then in a the few days’ window , they had available they ran around buying , - trying to buy all the seven million tickets. “ Trying ” to buy, . Because the consortium only managed to buy five million tickets. So winning was not inevitable, their chances were only about 5 five out of 7seven. As it happened, however, they did have the winning ticket. , so they were guaranteed winning the jackpot. The organization beforehand, the logistics of running around trying to buy these ticketsthey may , the nail-biting looking through the tickets, it’s easier . if you just to get a job. So if you are you’re thinking of getting together a consortium for the Powerball. , keep in mind that for this lottery there is there’s only a one in 292 million chance of winning. And tickets are 2 two bucks a pop. So you and your buddies are gonna going to have to come up with almost \\(600 million to buy every combo and take advantage of the law of inevitability.

Wilson Compton, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health. He spoke February 12th at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D. C. What we’ve seen is that the increase increased number of prescription prescriptions are driving , the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. Drugs that are prescribed to treat pain. So there is there’s tremendous availability of prescriptions. There is are some 260 million prescriptions written in each year for opioids. That’s not tablets, that’s prescriptions. So its it’s millions and millions of these , and some of them are available for diversion and used use inappropriately. Some of the pain patients may become hooked, . Or their meds may find their ways way to friends or relatives who take them recreationally. Or , a prescription opioid users user may transition to heroin. Heroin is just another opioid drug. , so the brain doesn’t distinguish , whether it comes from a pharmacy or it comes from a street drug dealer. What’s being been drawing the most public health attention , is the overdose death rates related to prescription of opioids and heroin, which have increased markedly over the last 15 years. Right now , we see drug overdose is overdoses killing nearly 50,000 persons in a given year in the United States. What are we doing about this? We are We’re focusing in three areas. We need to think about prevention in terms of reducing access to prescriptions as the ultimate upstream driver of this epidemic. We need to be thinking in terms to of saving lives acutely by providing greater access to the reversing drugs, drug - this is nalaoxone the naloxone - that blocks , the impactsimpact. So if somebody is overdose somebody’s overdosed and there are no they’re not breathing , and I can get this medication to them quickly. , I can resuscitate them. I guess there is That gives us a chance to help them turn their lives around with a the third aspect, which is greater access to effective treatment, through medication assistant medication-assisted treatment. But we also think we need to come up with better approaches for treating pain. Whether What are non-medical approaches , that might use brain stimulation techniques, for example, to treat pain. Whether ? What are other medications that don’t include the opioid existence system that might be useful. ?

Possibly because they need oxygen to relax . - exactly what’s in short supply on mountaintops. But there might may be a dietary way to get more oxygen to your blood vessels. : in the form of beet juice.

A few hours later, the researchers measured blood flow and artery diameters with ultrasound.

David Hemenway, he is . He’s the director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, he is . He’s also a professor of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. The gun violence discussion often seems to give short shift shrift to suicide. , even though more than 60% of the approximately 22000 32,000 annual U. S. firearms deaths are suicides. Hemenway spoke at January 6th 26th at the a Harvard School of Public Health forum on gun violence as a public health issue. The evidence is overwhelming, from case control studies to and ecological studies. For example, why do we have very different suicide rates across cities, across states, across regions in the United States, . To explain the differences in suicide rates across states. , turns out it is it’s not well explained at all by differences in mental health, it is it’s not well explained at all by differences in numbers the number of psychiatrists, it is it’s not even explained by differences in suicide radiation ideation among the population or even suicide attempts. What really explains the difference in the United States across the populations is the number of guns. Because of it’s gun suicides suicide which is so different. And someone who commits suicide with a gun very likely would not have either attempted or succeeded if the gun were not available. For example, a 2013 Swiss study , tracked men after the size of their army was cut in half, effectively when removing guns from half of that group, . The overall suicide rate went down, and the researcher researchers estimated that only 22% of all the men who would’ve would have killed themselves with a gun if it had been available wound up committing the act by other means.

H. Chan学院的一名健康政策与管理学教授。枪支暴力谈论通常因自杀而草草收场，即便在美国每年大约有32000起火拼死亡案件中有60%都是自杀行为。Hemenway在1月26日举行的哈夫公共健康学院的研讨会上指出枪支暴力犯罪属于公共健康问题。 来自于案例对照研究和生态研究得到的证据是非常有说服力的。比如，为什么不同城市，不同的州，以及美国境内不同区域的自杀率十分的不同？为了解释不同地区的自杀率之间的差异原因，研究结果显示这些原因根本不能用精神疾病的发病率不同来解释，根本不能用精神病医师的数量多少来解释，甚至也根本不能用人群中的自杀倾向或者自杀企图的比例上的差异来解释。真正在美国人口中出现的这种差异的普遍原因就是枪支的数量。因为是用枪支自杀的数量上有差异。 并且，如果没有枪，用枪支自杀的某人很可能本来就不用出现用枪自杀的动机以及后来用枪自杀成功的这种事儿。比如， 在2013年瑞士，有一项研究追踪调查了军火大小被减半后，就有效的把枪从作案凶器中的出现频率降低了一半。整个自杀率下降，而研究人员们估计，所有自杀的研究对象中，有22% 的人，如果可以选择枪这种工具，那么他们才会自杀，用其它工具他们就不进行自杀行为了。 枪支的出现只是使得你结束生命的冲动出现后更加容易的被满足。 含有Hemenway和其它研究人员关于枪支暴力犯罪属于公共健康问题的全部论坛内容已经可以在线收听。只需要用谷歌搜索“Harvard public health forum”选择相应内容即可。 "],

Well, the for NCSE is it’s one of the most powerful places on the Earth to show the difference differences between religious thinking and scientific thinking. Because for a very small minority of Christians who believe the Earth have been is 6,000 years old, the Grand Canyon is the best evidence , they have of Noah’s flood. Creation is to Creationists run multiple raft trips down the Colorado each year. A Web site touting sums, some says the trips will encourage your faith as we reveal the truth of God’s creation found in this gigantic reminint remnant of the Biblical Flood. Which creation is believed creationists believe occurred some 4,400 years ago. And of course , scientists of many, many different subdisciplines have figured out that the canyon is much older than that. There is, there’s the rocksthere is , there’s the biologythere is , there’s the hydrology. , it’s just a fantastic place to learn how science explains scientists explain the world around us.

But maybe the fictional Jones should have called them the &quot; Plump Marrieds“ . ” Because along with our friend offering couples unbright unbridled bliss. , marriage can cause them to pack on some extra pounds. That’s according to a study in The Journal of Family Issues. Sociologist Jay Teachman, at Western Washington University, examined data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. The data included in fell info about more than 3,000 African Americans over a 20-year period. Teachman tracked body mass indexbody-mass-index, BMI. , a measure of obesity, from adolescence to middle age. And he analyzed the relationship between BMI, marital status , and changes in marital status. It turned out that living without a partner usually equated to being thinner and having a lower BMI compared with married people and couples living together. The single folks included the never-marrieds and the divorced. Both men and women gained weight . but when it came to race, black women had the most rapid weight gain, followed by white women and then black and white men. The weight gain was just a few pounds . - but even a slighted slightly higher BMI is associated with weight-related health issues. Several reasons exist for the weight discrepancy between the single and married people. For example, married men and women may be less concerned about their body weight because they are they’re no longer actively seeking a mate. Plus, married people have a regular dining partner. , possibly leading to more meals. On the single side. , those who were are widowed , or have gone through a divorce may lose weight due to stress. So , well, while this news may not be good for the “ smug marrieds” . , it may be welcomed by Bridget Jones. The single, and very weight-conscious, Jones may actually of have had the easier path to staying thin than her married friends. Words worth to be remembered: unbridled adj. 无缰辔的,无羁勒的,无拘束的 smug adj. 沾沾自喜的，自以为是的；体面的 n. 自命不凡的人；书呆子 plump adj. 丰满的；充裕的；鼓起的 adv. 沉重地；突然地 n. 扑通声 v. （使）鼓起；变丰满，使丰满；（使）突然沉重地落下 16.1 譯文 Bridget Jones, 在印刷出版物或者荧屏上的动态形象上,都会称他们是得瑟的一对——那些欢喜冤家看上去十分美满。但是也许故事中的Jones本应该称他们为富态的一对。 因为，除了提供给夫妻双方无拘束的幸福生活以外，婚姻还会造成他们的体重直线上升。这是根据一项发表在《家庭报》杂志上的一项研究得出的结论。 西华盛顿大学的社会学家Jay Teachman，调研了全国青年纵向调查得到的数据。这些数据包括了对超过3000名的非洲裔美国人进行了长达20年的调查的所有信息。 Teachman调查了身体质量指数 BMI， 一种从青年到中年都是用(適用)的，衡量肥胖症的重要指标。然后他分析了BMI与体能(婚姻)状态以及体能(婚姻)状态改变之间的关系。结果显示，和已婚并且住在一起的夫妇相比较，没有伴侣的人通常较为苗条并且有比较低的BMI。单身人士中包括了一直未婚和已经离婚的人。 夫妻双方的体重都会增加，但是从种族的角度看，黑人妇女们的体重增长的最快，其次是白人妇女，然后才是黑人以及白人男士。说体重增加其实也不过就是几磅而已——可是BMI就算是少量的增加，也是密切联系着与增重相关的健康问题(密切相關)。 造成单身和已婚人士之间的体重的差异有很多原因。比如说，已婚男士和女士也许因为不在需要主动寻找合适的配偶所以减少了对自己体重的重视。此外，已婚后夫妻双方一般都会一起吃晚餐，这也可能使得他们(比單身者日常飲食次數更多)的饭量增加吧。从单身的角度看，寡居或者正在离婚的人士也许会因为压力而造成体重下降。 所以尽管这则消息对得瑟的夫妇们来讲或许并(不)算好消息，但对Bridget Jones来讲倒是还不错。这个单身的，十分关注体重的Jones, 也许真的有比她那些已婚朋友们更简便的保持苗条的方法。 "],

Some birds , songbirds aren’t born singing . - they have to learn to carry a tune. From So in the beginning , they just bubblebabble. Raissa de Boer, a behavior behavioral ecologist at the Unversity University of Antwerp in Belgium. And they learn from a tweetertutor, so they need an example song in order to learn it. She says that the example song might come from the chick’s father. And over time, the baby bird tweets tweaks that tweet, to make it a songits own. And then it takes almost a year until they are they’re fully adults adult, and until the next spring, for the final song to come out. De Boer and her colleagues investigated that song-learning process in canaries, using two groups of baby birds. : the first consists consisted of inbred birds, whose parents were siblings, ; the second had the parents that were unrelated. And the researchers found that the songs of inbred birds , and those of the other, outbred birds . Sounds sound pretty similar to the human ear. I cannot tell the difference. But computer analysis revealed that the inbred birds sang notes at slightly different pitches - and with tones that were not quite as pure. So basically the sing they sang out of tune, in comparison to outbred birds. The results appear in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Even though our untrained ears have a hard time telling the tones apart. , female canaries seem seemed to notice. They turned tended to lay smaller eggs, and fewer ovum of them, when they meet mated with inbred birds as opposed with to the better songsters. Suggesting that the quality of the songs’ gene a songbird’s genes may be revealed in its tunes.

Of course, when humans travel , they carry their pathogens with them. So scientists and historians have wondered if the Silk Road was a transmission route , not just for goods, but for infectious disease. Now we have the first hard evidence of ancient Silk Road travelers spreading their infections. The find comes from a 2000-year-old 2,000-year-old latrine , that had first been excavated in 1992. The report is in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. So the site is a relate relay station on the Silk Road in northwest China. It’s just to the eastern end of the Tarim Basin, which is a large and varied arid area . It’s just to the east of the Taklamakan desert, and not far from the Gobi Desert. So this is a dry part of China. Piers Mitchell, a paleopathologist , at the University of Cambridge, and one of the study’s authors, along with a his student Ivy Yeh and colleagues in China. In the latrine, archaeologists found used hygiene sticks rap wrapped with clothescloth. These were used for what you think they were used for. This escalation excavation was great . because the clothes were cloth was still preserved in and the fezzes which feces was still adherent to the clothes cloth on some of the sticks. So the archaeologists tagged archaeologist kept these sticks in the museum. And so my Ph. D. student, Ivy Yeh, who is the who’s first author of on the paper. , she went out to China took some scrapings from the fezzes feces adherent to the clothes cloth. So we were then able to analyze that down the microscope when she brought it back to Cambridge. Where they found legs eggs from parasites - including one from a liver fluke. And that’s the exciting one because that’s only found in East eastern and southern China and in Korea. , where they have marched the marshy areas that would have the right snails and the right fish. The fluke needs snails and fish for its lifecycle. , but there were no such snails or fish in this dry region of China. So the unlucky travelers traveler who harbored the parasite had to have transported the disease to that spot. Well , firstly it tells us that people were doing a very long journey, journeys along the long Silk Road . and you might think that’s obvious. But no one really knew how long people were traveling. Some people may have been trading, don’t need to go only going short distances selling their goods on to the next person. And so the goods might have gone all over the way on along the Silk Road, but people might not. But we know that some people were doing huge distances. Secondly , it shows that you know this was, would be a viable route for the spread of those other infectious diseases like Bubonic plague , and leprosy , and anthrax . that people had previously been suggested might have been spread between East Asia and Europe along the Silk Road. Because bone modern genetic analyses have just shown similarities between the strains of one end and the other. Mitchell says there is there’s much more work to be done to better understand the spread of diseases around the world. Perhaps from analyzing skeletons - or various other kinds of remains - to be found along the Silk Road.

So farms need to do more to keep up with demand. And If we look to the future, at today’s per capital capita fish intake around the world . we will would need to double aquaculture production. Ron Hardy is the University of Idaho’s Director of Aquaculture Research. He presented his research at a the recent International Symposium on Fish Nutrition and Feeding in Sun Valley, Idaho, which him he also chaired. In the wild, rainbow trout eat insects and other, smaller fish. But Hardy says there aren’t enough little fish to feed larger fish in the wild and still meet market demand as the human population increases. So he’s used selected selective breeding to create strains of farmed fish that get by on food that’s less expensive than little fish . - feed made from soybeanscorns , corn and weedwheat. Some of the farmed fish really thrived. thrive: 16 years ago, Hardy had to wait a year for a one-pound trout. These days, his efforts yield trout up to four times as large in the same amount of time. So, it become like would be kind of like if you are were going to you know breed a, I don’t know , box ? dogs. So we’ve got everything from Rottweilers to , you know , little Scotties or whatever. But the farmed fish aren’t are not completely vegetarian. Soybeans don’t have skeletons, they don’t have bones . and the bones in fish meal are a major source of mineral minerals for the fish, for example. And much like humans, fish diets require omega-3 fatty acids, not found in terrestrial plants. So Hardy has to add a little fish-oil back into the plant-based feed. For those of us without waiterswaders, this kind of aquaculture is our best shot at a fish fry.

Out in the wild, some species are less picky. Take Anopheles arabiensis, common in East Africa. They will They’ll feed on cattle, dogs, goats, pigs, people , - wherever they can find a warm meal. But what Main and his colleagues wanted to know was whether the blood suckers bloodsuckers’ choice a of victim might be genetically determined. So they sequenced the genomes of 48 arabiensis mosquitos mosquitoes from Tanzania , which had fed on either humans or cows. And they found that bugs with cow blood in their bellies had one partially rearranged chromosome, compared to those who who’d snacked on human blood , which could explain the preferences in meal choicechoices. The study is in the journal PLoS Genetics. If that genetic switch really does make cows more attractive than we are to mosquitos. mosquitoes, in theory , we can could genetically engineer them to steal steer clear of people. And their cow victims don’t get human malaria.

Davis分校的一位研究蚊子的遗传学家，他还兼职做蚊子的食物供应商。所以对我来讲还不是太差。但是当被几百只蚊子咬过之后，实验室中的某些人可是会感到非常痒的。 在野外，某些种类的胃口还不是很挑剔。 就拿东非地区常见的阿拉伯按蚊来说吧。它们会咬牛，狗，山羊，猪， 和人——只要它们能发现这是一顿温暖的食物。但是，Main和他的同事们想知道是否这些吸血鬼对食物挑剔的结果其实是遗传决定的。所以他们对从坦桑尼亚捉来的已经尝过人或者小牛的血液的48种按蚊。 结果他们就发现，对比已经尝过人学的蚊子，吃过牛血的这种蚊子含有部分重组过后的染色体，这就可以解释为何有些蚊子会有食物偏好。该研究已发表在《公共科学图书馆：遗传学》杂志上。 如果，遗传转换真的使得牛比人类 对这些蚊子更有吸引力的话， 理论上我们能对它们进行遗传修饰以便人类完全引导它们的生活史。而被咬的牛是不会得疟疾的。这只是了解你的对手的一个机会。 所以，我们对这些蚊子了解的约多，我们将会更好的对它们进行掌控。 "],

By the early 70s, she’d already been a Bond girl, Steve McQueen’s love interesting interest in Bullitt and an air hostess and Captain Dean Martin’s girlfriend in Paro peril in the sky blockbuster Airport. And then, one day in 1972, Jacqueline Bisset was in Paris - not so much for the last tango with as the disco tech , - when an emissary arrived from UAE royalty. It’s actually rather a strange story, from my point of view. I was in Paris as I used to go sometimes quite often, and I often used to go to a place and dance. And I was staying that particular evening in a hotel I’ve I’d never stayed at before in my life. , and about 11 : 00 o’clock in the morning. , a very out-of-breath handsome young man came rushing up the stairs, knocking on my door, sayingthere is , you must, there’s a phone call for meyou.

It’s very unfamiliar to me. But you think these are all connected somehow. Well, first, earthquakes in Italy turn tend to occur more in groups or sequences than a lot of other places in the world. This is somewhat unique to Italy. It’s not a striking difference, but it’s a noticeable one. And it’s probably because the faults there are relatively relative young. , less than a 1 million years old. Compare that to the San Andreas’, which is over 10 million years old. So these are little kind of broken shards of faults that haven’t really been organized organised by repeated earthquakes into a long continuous smooth fault. So, that means that if you jostle one, you turn tend to move the others around it. And no one fault is able to rupture for a very long distance and produce a very large earthquake. So we get these little groups or families of moderate size moderate-sized events. But it’s interesting that you mentioned L’Aquila , that was several years ago. , there was some pre-rumbling that happenhappened, I’m not sure what was going on afterward and afterwards, then in August you have once, that’s a long separation. , and then a few weeks late later you’ve got another one and then another one. You know, the timing , as well as the distance between these events , seems curious to me. I am I’m not sure what to make of it. Well, it’s interesting. Take a typical earthquake, say a magnitude 6six. It’s gonna going to produce aftershocks. Aftershocks have a unique property. : the longer you go by in time, the more spread out they are. But their magnitudes don’t get smaller with time.

In the example above, the speaker didn’t know whether the guy was serious or joking, whether he really didn’t care about her or whether he was trying to hide his true feelings. Other feelings that you might have when you “don’t know what to make of” something are: You’re not sure whether something is good or bad. You can’t decide what something is. You don’t know why a person said something the way that they said it. 28.1 譯文 这种展开方式我不太熟悉。但你觉得它们之间都是有某种联系的？ 嗯，首先，相比于世界上许多其他地方来说，意大利的地震更趋向于多震源或连续发生。意大利在这点上多少有点特别。这个特点不是多么突出，却也是很明显的。这很可能是因为意大利的地质断层形成时间还不够长，还不到一百万年。把它跟圣安地列斯的断层一比，人家已经一千多万年了。所以这些都只是断层碎片，还没有受到地震的频繁推挤而变成那种大范围的连续光滑断层。那么这就意味着，如果动了一个断层，那它周围其他的断层也会跟着移动。而断层中的任何一个都不可能造成大范围地震，震感也不可能很强。所以才会有这些小的中级震群或震族。 但是你提到了几年前拉奎拉的那次地震很有意思，先是有一些震动——我不确定之后发生了什么——然后在八月份又发生了一次，这中间隔了很长一段时间，结果几周之后又发生了一次，然后又发生了一次。这几次地震之间的时间间隔和距离间隔都让我觉得很奇怪。我不知道该怎么理解这个问题。 嗯，确实有趣。就一次典型的地震来说，就说六级地震吧。它会产生余震。余震有一种独一无二的特性：过去的时间越长，波及的范围就越广。但是震级并不会随着时间而降低。 "],

There's no disgrace. 你不必大惊小怪。没有什么丢人的事。 Ecclesiastes: n. 传道书 29.1 譯文 又逢一年开学时。八月银行假期一过便预示暑假即将结束。再过不久就要开学了。对我们这群没有子女的人来说，开学临近最明显的迹象要数那些校服广告。为新学期准备服装可算是人生一课。学嘛是一年跟着一年的上，个子嘛也是一年跟着一年的长。12个月前的校服现在穿不上了，这不就得买新衣裳了。我妈妈通常给我买大好几码的校服，这样就不用年年买新衣服了。 哲学家朱利安（Julian Baggini）在昨天的卫报上评论说，生命表现为向前移动的直线，但同时它也是循环往复的。把重心放在当前，而不过分关注遥远的未来，这样我们的生活会更好。 作为一名基督徒，我立马想到《旧约传道书》上面说的：“凡事都有定期，天下万物皆有定时。”这部分选段经常出现在葬礼上。它讲述的不仅是死亡，还包括新生，提醒我们生或死好比夏季与冬季并非意味终结，而是漫长循回中的一部分。它仿佛在向默哀者低语：“节哀。生命仍在继续。” "],

The worst of that episode was in October, 2014 when there was a tackle attack of the so-called Russian battles battlers against the Sakharov Centre. What as was going on at the Sakharov Centre? It was prompted by the Coming Out Day , which was a stage staged at the Sakharov Center Centre by the LGBT activists. They were expecting that actually a limited number as usual who would turn up for this action, like 8,10 eight, ten people, the usual sort of arriving actvists. right-wing nationalistic activists, but they didn’t expect actually the huge crowd of whom who will turn out up, calling themselves anti-maidan people.

AlrightAll right, before you reach for your radio, please do not switch us off, . This is important. Governments were debating, yet again, whether it was time to cut the subsidies that some of them give to their farmers. It’s an old saw. Many, especially in the poor world, have been arguing against , since practiced this practice for years. Farmers in poor countries get much less you see than the generous handouts for super-rich farmers in places like Europe, the US , and Japan, distorting the global market markets, some say. But those rich governments are unwilling to change a dacades-old-practicedecades-old practice. And this, in part, is our theme today in Business Daily. We’re looking first at one specific example, . Argentina is a major agriculture agricultural producer. The newly-elected center-right centre-right government there has been struggling to change a state-driven policy of handouts that has become bloated and some say unsustainable, both for the economy and the environment. Grace Livingstone reports. I have I’ve come to the Argentine flatlands, the Pampas, to see what farmers ’ ink think of the new government. The Pampas used to be synonymous with cattle and cowboys. , but now most of this area is planted with genetically-modified soya. So I’ve come to the city of Rosario to talk to the Soya Association, which represents all those who grow or process soya. It’s a very smart glass building, giving you an indication of just how much wealth the soya industry has generated.

Tylor came from a prosperous Quaker business family. , so he had the resources for a long trip. In 1855 , in his early 20s, he left for the New World . and after befriending Henry Christy, a Quaker archaeologist archeologist he met in his travels, they ended up riding together through the Mexican countryside, visiting Aztec ruins and dusty pueblos. Christy was already an experienced archaeologist, a dunter archeologist and under his tutorage tried to learn tutelage Tylor learned how to work in the field. , and his Mexican surgen filed sergeant fired in him an enthusiasm for the study a thorough way of faraway societiesancients , ancient and modern, that lasted the rest of his life. In 1871, he published his masterwork, Primitive Culture, which can lay claimed claim to being the first work of modern anthropology. Over the decades as his beard moved morphed from a lastrus lustrous Garibaldi to a vast seavery silvery cumulonimbus boost that would have made Gandalf jealous. Tylor added to his knowledge of the worlds of world’s peoples through study in the museum and the library. Primitive Culture was, in some respects, a chorus quarrel with another book that had “ culture ” in the title , - Matthew Arnold’s Culture and Anarchy. , a collection that had appeared just two years earlier. For Arnold, the poet the and literary critic, culture was the ’pursuit of our total affection perfection by means of getting to knowand , on all the matters which most concern us, the best , which has been thought and said in the world. ’ Words worth to be remembered: dryer vs. drier: Drier is a comparative adjective meaning more dry. A dryer is one of many types of electrical appliances used to dry things. The words were once interchangeable. The distinction crept into the language through the 20th century and has only recently solidified. Some dictionaries still list the words as variants of each other, but the words are almost always kept separate in 21st-century publications. archaeology vs. archeology : Archaeology is the standard spelling throughout the English-speaking world, even in American English, where the a is dropped from many words traditionally containing ae (or æ, as it used to be rendered). Archeology is a somewhat common variant. It is about two centuries old and is common enough to have earned its way into many of the major dictionaries, but it has hasn’t gained much traction in edited writing. The traditional spelling remains the safer choice. befriend [bɪ’frend]:v. 待人如友, 帮助 I asked a certain comrade to befriend this fellow so that he would not interrupt our talks. 我请一位伙伴向这家伙套近乎以便能让他不来打断我们的谈话。 pueblo [’pwebləʊ]: n. 印第安人村庄 Early Amerindians related to the Pueblo Indians is known for skill in making baskets. 和普韦布洛印地安人有联系地早期美国印地安人;以编篮子的技术而闻名。 tutelage: n. 指导，指引；保护，监护，托管 sergeant: n. 警官；军士，中士；高等律师 morph: n. 语素；变种；变 v. 在屏幕上变换图像；改变 lustrous: adj. 有光泽的,光辉的; The moon was above, lustrous and serene. 天上的月亮皎洁肃穆。 cumulonimbus: n. 积雨云 quarrel: n. 吵架；反目；怨言；争吵的原因；方头凿 vi. 吵架；争论；挑剔 literay critic: 文学评论家 anarchy: n. 无政府状态，混乱 Edward Burnett Tylor 爱德华·伯内特·泰勒（Edward Burnett Tylor，1832－1917），英国文化人类学的奠基人、古典进化论的主要代表人物。泰勒出生于伦敦一个富有的工厂主家庭，接受了良好的私人教育。 Matthew Arnold 英国诗人、评论家。拉格比公学校长、托马斯·阿诺德之子。他所倡导的“文化批评”理论在西方文学史及思想史上占有重要的地位。阿诺德自称为“英国文化的倡导者”,后人尊他为“文化使徒”。 32.1 譯文 19世纪，同众多感染肺结核的英国人一样，爱德华·伯内特·泰勒遵从医嘱离开英国，前往更温暖、更干燥的地区。泰勒出生于一个富裕的贵格会商人家庭，故而他有足够的资金进行长途旅行。1855年，二十多岁的泰勒动身前去美洲的途中结交了贵格会考古学家亨利·克里斯蒂。最后二人一同奔赴墨西哥乡下，考察阿兹特克遗址和满是灰尘的普埃布洛村落。 克里斯蒂当时已是经验颇丰的考古学家。在他的指导下，泰勒学会如何在考古现场工作。而受墨西哥当地巡佐的影响，泰勒对这里的人类族群研究——不论是古代的还是近代的——产生了浓厚的热情，这份热情一直燃烧到他生命的最后一刻。1871年，泰勒的代表作《原始文化》出版，该书可以称得上是近代人类学的第一巨作。随后几十年间，当他的胡子从光亮的加里波第式变为让甘道夫都会嫉妒的银白色长髯，泰勒一直通过博物馆和图书馆学习世界人类族群方面的知识。从某些方面来讲，《原始文化》是对另一部书《文化与无政府状态》（马修·阿诺德著）的驳斥。《文化与无政府状态》系列书籍比《原始文化》早两年出版。文化之于阿诺德——这位诗人及文学评论家——是一种对完美的追求，即了解与我们关系最密切的所有事物，领略世界上最好的想法和说法。 "],

It’s generally defined as the action of saving or being saved from sin, error , or evil. We take this to mean that someone has committed an act which is sinfull sinful or evil. My guest today did nothing of the thoughtsort. In fact, she was subjected to an active act of terrible violence and brutality, and it happened when she was only thirteen13. Madeleine Black was raped, yet today she can talk of having been redeemed through the active act of forgiveness. Madeleine, how does one do that? How does one seek or gained gain that redemption? It wasn’t something that I ever really set out to do. It There was a combination of about three things. I thought that I had worked it , really were when well and I was healed. But, but there was always something lurking underneath . and when my oldest daughter became nearly thirteen 13, and it was while whilst I was having therapy for over three years . that my therapist suggested to me that maybe they weren’t born rapists. And, and you know, I just. .. , I just, there was no way I want wanted to forgive them, I just want wanted somebody to kidnap them, type tie them up, rape and torture them for hours on end like they had done to me. , but he planted a seed in my mind . and that seed started to grow . and I, I just really wanted to understand what did it take for them to take that path. , because they weren’t much older than me, . They were maybe 17,18. I wanted to know, how could they be so violent toward towards another human being, what had they seen or heard or experienced themselves that could have made make them behave in that way. ?

Alfred Prufrock)奠定诗名，是现代主义运动的重要作品，写于1910年，在1915年发表；此诗具有很浓的讽刺意味，刻画当时社会背景下，人们对爱情及生活的复杂心理。他重要的诗作包括《Poems》(诗集1919)、《The Waste Land》(荒原1922)、《The Hollowmen》(中空的人1925)、《Ash Wednesday》(圣灰星期三1930)及《Four Quartets》(四个四重奏1945)。他写过七部剧本，其中以《Murder in the Cathedral》(教堂谋杀1935)为着。他在1948年以《Order of Merit》得诺贝尔文学奖。《焦灼的诺顿》（Burnt Norton）是 《四个四重奏》(Four Quartets)中的第一首诗；他书写时间与救赎(Time and Redemption)的特质，他的意旨在强调个人对目前状况及了解宇宙秩序的需要。 38.1 譯文 “现在和过去的时光， 也许都存在于未来之中，且未来的时光包含于过往。假如所有时间都永恒存在，所有时间都无法履行。”这是写于20世纪30年代，艾略特《四个四重奏》中《焦灼的诺顿》的开场白。虽然你们可能很熟悉这几句，但你们也许从来没有思考过它们的意义。诚然，因为一个词“也许”，艾略特的语气听起来不是十分确定，但他的意思已经很清晰：如果时间向一条河流一样滚滚向前只是我们的主观臆测（译者注：就是时间没有先后），所有的时间和事件都已经发生，那么我们就根本无力改变未来，更别说过去了（译者注：看过interstellar的人可以联想电影中四维空间的相关镜头）。人会倾向于将艾略特的这个观点和自由意志以及道德责任联系起来，毕竟这是人作为社会动物最为关心的问题。不过，在这里我只想着眼于时间本身，探讨一下人对时间的感知。 第四维比前三维费解得多，人想抓住它时，它总是能从我们的指尖溜走。想一想，如果我们不同意艾略特的想法，认为过去的已经过去且不再存在，而未来还没有发生，那么所有的现实都会与此时此刻紧密相关。 "],

The adaptation and the direction is by American director Derek Cianfrance, whose two previous features, Blue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines certainly moved muted me to tears.

Kendis Paris lives in Denver, Colorado with her Anglican priest husband and her their two children. She used to spend her days making bread and cheese, home with her the kids. But now she travels the country, training drivers to recognize recognise and report human trafficking. Her organization organisation is called Truckers Against Trafficking, or TAT.

So , could you please explain to us, Sarada, what the role of a speech writer is? Sure, . And I would I’d be interested to hear how it might be different for Tina and Kosovo. But here for us, the role of a speech writer is to really help a speaker find their voice. For example, figure out what they want to say and how they want to say it. And then, you know, the job really have of a speech, as far as I believe, is to persuade the an audience to believe something, to do something. And so, you know, your job is as a speech writer, and in my view, is not to come up with the ideas for a speaker, but to help them holding hone in and clarify their own thinking . and could develop an argument and then find the most persuasive way to deliver that argument. I happen to agree. For me, it was very important tothrough , sort of, understand the issues that were dealt dear to President Jahjaga, to her vision. Alsoversion, also to weave in personal stories, policy stanceand that’s since , in that sense you want the speech speeches to be impactful and memorable. , and true to the acharacter character of the president and the issues that she and her teams team hold dealdear. That’s really interesting, this idea of being true to the character of the president or of the person you are writing for. I mean, do you have to know them well to write a good speech? For me, it was very helpful to be by the president’s side and hear her talk, and hear her interact with various audiences, her counterparts, or just the ordinary people in cost of allKosovo. When I wrote a speech, I almost felt like I had to give up my own voice and adopt her voice and her vocabulary , so that the speech was closest to her vature natural voice. So yes, you need to match your speech with her to their words or their physical chemistry. Words worth to be remembered: hone in : 磨炼; Improves my ability to hone in on an idea and learn to execute it quickly as well as meticulously. 改善我迅速深入一个创意骨子里的能力，并且学习如何迅速而尽善尽美地体现它; 锁定目标，进一步查明或发现 例句：We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employees maximizing their skills again in no time. 我们会全力研究您公司的问题，让您的职员在最短的时间里再发挥出他们的最大才能。 dear: adj. 关切 例句： This is a subject very dear to the hearts of academics up and down the country. 这个话题举国上下的学者都非常关切。 this idea of being true to the character of the president: 符合总统本身的特点 46.1 譯文 演讲写作也是一种职业，我想并不是所有人都知道还有这样的职业存在。那么，萨拉达，你能给我们讲讲演讲撰稿人是做什么的吗？ 当然可以。而且我也很想听听对蒂娜和科索沃来说会有什么不一样的地方。对于我们来说，演讲撰稿人的职责就是真正地帮助演讲者发现自己的心声，弄清楚自己想要表达什么、怎样去表达。我个人觉得，演讲的真正作用就是说服听众去相信某件事、去做某件事。所以在我看来，作为一名演讲撰稿人，你的工作并不是替演讲者出主意，而是帮助他们发现并且弄清楚自己的想法、确立论据，然后找到最有说服力的方法来传达这条论据。 跟我的想法不谋而合。对我来说，了解亚希亚加总统所关心的问题、了解她的看法是很重要的。如果你想让演讲有影响力、令人难忘、又符合总统本身的特点、还要反应她和她的内阁成员们所关心的问题，那么在演讲里穿插她的个人经历以及她的政治立场也是很重要的。 这点很有意思，“符合总统本身的特点”或者其他你为之写作的人物的特点。那么为了写出好的演讲稿，你是不是得充分了解他们才行？ 对我来说，能在总统的身边听她谈话、听她跟各种各样的人交谈——跟她身份相当的人交谈，或是跟科索沃的普通民众——对我是很有帮助的。当我在写演讲稿的时候，我会觉得几乎得完全摒弃自己的声音，要用她的语气、她的用词，这样演讲才会最贴近她本身的说话方式。所以，对的，演讲稿是要跟演讲者的谈吐、跟他们本身的化学效应相匹配的。 "],

According to official figures from the Ministry of Justice. , at least 93,000 people are under investigation for their elegy alleged links to the coup plotters and around 34,000 are facing charges.

But there are others who are very reluctant. In the Second World War, one of the combatants , S. L. A. Marshall observed that many didn’t shoot. He wrote a study , called Men Against Fire , in which he concluded that there was a reluctance to kill. There They were what were called non-firers. Fear of killing rather than fear of being killed was, he said, was the most common cause of battle failure. Marshall’s methods of research have since been questioned, but the broad conclusion is still accepted by many. : soldiers often simply won’t fire. The referent Reverend Dr Giles Fraser’s phrases are Fraser lectures on morality and ethics at the academy of the British Ministry of Defense. “ I think there is there’s a deep human reluctance to kill other people. S. L. A. Marshall found that only 15 % to 20% of combatants in history combat infantry were able to fire their weapons on the enemy. And there were 80%, there 80% that were defects or can’t change subjects de facto conscientious objectors when they come it came to the point to fire of firing their own weapon. And this I’d say it is extraordinary. At Gettysburg, this is another extraordinary story. There were 27,000 rifles, muskets , left on the field of battle . and 90% of them were loaded.

Marshall观察到当时很多人都没有开枪。他做了一个名叫《反对战火的人》的研究，在这份报告里他得出的结论是人们不愿意杀戮。这些人叫做不开枪的人。Marshall说害怕杀戮而非害怕被杀其实是战斗失败的最常见的原因。Marshall研究的方法虽然一直遭到质疑，但是他得出的大结论还是被广泛接受，那就是士兵一般不愿开枪。Giles Frasers博士在英国国防部学院做了以道德为主题的演讲。 “我认为人类自内心深处就对杀戮有排斥。S.L.A. Marshall发现战斗步兵队伍中，只有15%到20%的人能够朝敌人开枪。而80%的人在面临开枪那一刻实际上是会产生抵触情绪而不愿意这么做的。我认为这个发现很特别。葛底斯堡的战役也很特别。当时有27000把来复枪和步枪散落在战场上，其中90%的枪都上了膛。实际上这是因为没有人开枪。” "],

And to learn more about that, I’ve come here to the Amaravati Monastery in its peaceful rural setting , near the town of Berkhamsted , north of London.

If you were you’re hanging onto on to your possessions, or you’re hanging onto on to the regrets that you have . and thinking in terms of the customary Buddist Buddhist pattern that we are of understanding . There is that there’s a pattern of past lives and future lives that we are we’re all experiencing, so the present life is one of a life large sequence. And so the basic process of Buddhist practice and the underlying current of it is trying to try to end rebirth altogether. ” “ I think this is the most fascinating concept. It’s very ancient. It emerges within Indian tradition, Buddhist tradition follows it, sick Sikh tradition generally follows it. But what’s going on with it? What’s the driver? , the driver of reincarnation , as the ideas it developed, was the one that of merit. But this idea of merit of also drives the Jewish , Christian , Islamic world , which is not a reincarnation world. , but it is a world of life, death, judgment, judgement and an afterlife. When in the West, we pick up this concept of reincarnation, we picked pick it up rather positively and joyfully. In actual fact, it’s something you just gotta go through and through and through and through , until of course , you gain release. ” Words worth to be remembered: stepping stone: 垫脚石；跳板；进身之阶 例： The next rock in your path may be a stepping stone. 也许人生路上的下一个绊脚石就是垫脚石。 hang on to: 紧紧抓住；紧握 例： For most nations, it is a great achievement to hang on to what you already have. 对于大多数国家来说，为了已经拥有的东西而坚持不懈是伟大的成就。 clinging:adj. 执着的；有黏性的；紧靠着的 v. cling的现在分词；抓紧 grasping: adj. 贪婪的，贪心的 v. grasp的现在分词；抓住 customary: adj. 习惯的；通常的 underlying current: 其潜在的趋势 altogether: adv. 完全地；总共；总而言之 reincarnation: n. 再赋与肉体，化身，再生，转世，轮回 merit: n. 优点，价值；功绩；功过 vt. 值得 vi. 应受报答 afterlife:n. 来世;晚年 joyfully:adv. 欢喜地;高兴地;快乐地 in actual fact: 事實上 53.1 譯文 对佛教徒来说，夕阳红的晚年是通向往生的进身之阶。为了深入了解这一点，我来到了伦敦北部靠近巴克汉姆斯特镇的一个宁静偏远的景点——阿玛拉瓦第佛法道场。我将拜见其住持方丈Ajahn Amaro。 “从佛教的视角来看，引起最大麻烦的东西是我们依赖于附属物的习惯，无论我们是生还是死。如果你紧握住你的财富不放，或是放不下过去的悔恨，那么以传统的佛教模式思考，或者说理解我们都在经历着的前世和来世，今生只是一长串序列中的一部分。所以佛教修行的基本过程及其潜在的趋势是终止轮回转世。” “我认为这是最令人着迷的一个概念。它非常古老，起源于印度教传统，佛教继承了它，锡克教大致上也沿袭了它。然而之后发生了什么？随着理念的发展，行善所得的功德成为了投胎转世的驱动者。这种功德的理念同样推动了不存在投胎再生的犹太教、基督教、伊斯兰教世界，形成了生死、审判以及来世的世界。在西方，我们习得了轮回转世的理念，我们相当正面且愉快地接受了它。事实上，它就是你不断地经历磨难直到最后得到解脱的过程。” "],

A planned press conference was scheduled for this week on the matteris . It’s now being canceledcancelled. Mr . Trump would only say via his tweeter Twitter feed that no new deal will deals would be done while he was he’s in the White House. That adds to an earlier pledge he made, that he will would step down from the day-to-day management of his far-flung global business empire. Still, many say those measures don’t go far enough. So , what are the precedents for how presidents deal with their business affairs once in office? A question for Norman Eisen, who is was the Chief White House Ethics Lawyer for the Obama administration. Ever since the passage of the Ethics in Government Act in 1978 that American presidents have utilised utilized what we refer to as a qualified blind trust or the equivalent. That means that they take their business interest interests, and they give them to the trustee to dispose of, convert it into cash. , and then reinvest behind the wallet a wall of blindness. So the president doesn’t know what his investments are, in order to avoid conflicts.

Words worth to be remembered: sanctum: n. 圣所,密室,私室 Tottenham Hotspur: 托特纳姆热刺足球俱乐部，简称热刺，是英格兰超级联赛的球队之一。它是二十世纪首支成为联赛及英格兰足总杯双料冠军的球队。在1963年夺得欧洲优胜者杯宝座，是英国首支取得欧洲赛事锦标的队伍。 a word of mouth 口碑: Few things offer better word of mouth than a rocketing stock price. 最有助于打造良好口碑的莫过于飙升的股价。 billboard:n. 广告牌；布告板 v. 宣传 58.1 譯文 但首先，球员过去的收入是怎么样的?我们是如何结束这种观念的呢? 1973年，新闻记者Hunter Davies被允许进入托特纳姆热刺足球俱乐部进行内部随访。Davies花了一个季度的时间和球队呆在一起，他和他们一起训练，一起去球员家做客，亲眼目睹更衣室里球员间的混战打闹。在当今无比谨慎的媒体管理和周密严格的安保措施之下，没有任何体育记者可以再次被准许拥有这种前所未有的近距离接触行为。 起初，在一个19人组成的团队中，没有一个球员有专门的代理人、律师和会计师，也没有球队经理来关照他们。这只是一个口碑的问题。每周他们可以拿到大概200英镑。自20世纪70年代起他们就住在20,000英镑房租的房子里，像阿森纳，在节目中也没有他的广告代言。简直令你难以置信，不是么？ billboard排行榜中都没有有关他们广告的一席之地的原因在于，他们认为自身的价值远不止于这些。他们的价值立于那些不入流的广告营销之上。抱有这种想法的球员时代已经整整结束了超过100年的时间了。 每周两百英镑放到现在就是2181英镑的价值，可以说是相当大的一笔钱，但这笔钱和现在的顶级球员所能赚的相比还够不着边儿。2004年，Hunter Davies受邀编写韦恩鲁尼的自传，那时鲁尼19岁，他的自传被认为是五个球员自传系列中的第一个，以至于其价值盖过了他剩下的的足球生涯。 "],

So if you take the number 3 three, and you double it, then you will you’ll get 6 six. And 6 six is an even number. So that would will be the definition of even numbers. And zero will pass that test.

A Diabulimia is an umbrella term , where people with Type 1 Diabetes deliberately reduce or admit omit the insulin that they need to be taking relative to the sugars, the blood sugars that they have and to the carbohydrates that they are eating with the aim of keeping their weight down or losing weight. When did you first become aware of it? Well, I’ve been working as a psychiatrist with people with diabetes for nearly 15 years at Kings College Hospital. , and I’ve been seeing it ever since then. So it’s not new, people have always done it? I think it’s, I think that’s right . That’s that there’s probably been an element of manipulating the insulin in people who have with Type 1 Diabetes ever since it’s probably been invented. And I think what’s happening is that we are now getting increasing awareness of it. Well, we’ll talk about Emma’s experiments own experience in a moment. , but Libby, from your point of view as an organization. organisation, just tell us a little bit about the impact of insulin on the body, . What does it do? Insulin regulates your blood glucose levels, . Glucose is another word for sugar. So people who don’t have Type 1 Diabetes, their pancreas produces the right amount of insulin for the food they eat. For The people who do have Type 1 Diabetes, their bodies aren’t making that insulin. , so they have to inject the right amount.

And so my father dad used to always say I it was such enthusiasm: &quot; You held on until the cloth clothes line broke. &quot; But of course , they were there to catch me. , and they said that was really a sign to them that I was gonna be a great real gymnast. And then eventually , I would’ve started gymnastic would start gymnastics by the age of 3 three in the United States. , and I was put in a tennis class and a gymnastic gymnastics class.

If you were you’re religious, it might seem to go against what this time of year is all about. , and certainly , there is there’s no shortage of church leaders who rail against the commercialization commercialisation of Christmas. Yet a lot of these this conspicuous feasting does have a religious origin. In a moment, we’ll hear how many religious holidays were festivals. But first, the link between religion and consumption hasn’t gone unnoticed by food companies and retailers. In fact, increasingly we’re seeing religious food stuffs, marked as kosher or halal for instance, going mainstream. You can find those marks on a whole range of products now sold in many Western supermarkets. So how did that happen? How did kosher and halal become as mainstream as, say, vegetarianism in the food industry? Elizabeth Hotson went to find out , here in London. There was a time when “if you want wanted a bagelyou get , you’d go to a Jew’s Jewish bakery. ” or a halal butcher for land slaughtered lamb slaughted according to Islamic law. Nowadays supermarket supermarkets stock what were was once considered specialist and rather exotic items. , and savi savvy businesses are taking advantagesadvantage. On a rainy day in London, I took refuge in Gifto . – a Pakistani restaurant to the west of the city.

We are We’re not the earliest people on the square , though, . The pavement on the main road is thickening with farmers from the surrounding hill villages, laying out their vegetables for keen inspection by the city people who were themselves farmers only five minutes ago.

Because we don’t just expect the company companies we buy from to be profitable; we expect them to be good corporate citizens, too. , which might explains explain recent news reports that Amazon has quietly appointed a new director of social responsibility. The appointment comes as the online retailer faces mounting criticism over its business practices. A recent article in the New York Times criticized criticised the company for the way it treated its employees. It spoke of a bruising culture and turner back-stabbingthe internal , something Amazon’s boss has since insisted it’s is not an accurate portrayal. Whatever the case, Christine Bader, Corporate Social Responsibility Campaigner and the former adviser to the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for Business and Human Rights, is now Amazon’s Director of Social Responsibility , or CSR. Here , she’s speaking to me on our sister programme , Business Matters last year, when I asked her , “ what is does CSR actually meant? ” mean. I think the part of the problem with the way that the for quote-unquote corporate responsibility felt field has evolved is that no one knows what it means.
