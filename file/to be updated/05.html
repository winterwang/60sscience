        <p class="linetext">One of the things we know for sure <span class="diff_alert">,</span> in <span class="diff_add">the</span> United States <span class="diff_alert">,</span> is that a gun in <span class="diff_off">a</span> <span class="diff_add">the</span> home increases the likelihood that someone in the home will die <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_off">in</span> <span class="diff_add">a</span> violent death <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_add">-</span> from gun accidents, from a <span class="diff_off">women</span> <span class="diff_add">woman</span> being murdered by a man <span class="diff_off">or</span> <span class="diff_add">in</span> an <span class="diff_off">intimated</span> <span class="diff_add">intimate</span> partner <span class="diff_off">violent</span> <span class="diff_add">violence</span> situation <span class="diff_alert">,</span> and particularly <span class="diff_alert">,</span> by suicide. </p><p class="linetext">David Hemenway<span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_off">he</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_add">He's</span> the director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center<span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_off">he</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_add">He's</span> also a professor of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.

The gun violence discussion often seems to give short <span class="diff_off">shift</span> <span class="diff_add">shrift</span> to suicide<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="Even ">even </span>though more than 60% of the approximately <span class="diff_off">22000</span> <span class="diff_add">32,000</span> annual U. S. firearms deaths are suicides. Hemenway spoke <span class="diff_off">at</span> January <span class="diff_off">6th</span> <span class="diff_add">26th</span> at <span class="diff_off">the</span> <span class="diff_add">a</span> Harvard School of Public Health forum on gun violence as a public health issue. </p><p class="linetext">The evidence is overwhelming<span class="diff_alert">,</span> from case control studies <span class="diff_off">to</span> <span class="diff_add">and</span> ecological studies. For example, why do we have very different suicide rates across cities, across states, across regions in <span class="diff_add">the</span> United States<span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="to ">To </span>explain the differences in suicide rates across states<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="Turns ">turns </span>out <span class="diff_off">it</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">it's</span> not well explained at all by differences in mental health, <span class="diff_off">it</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">it's</span> not well explained at all by differences in <span class="diff_off">numbers</span> <span class="diff_add">the</span> <span class="diff_add">number</span> of psychiatrists, <span class="diff_off">it</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">it's</span> not even explained by differences in suicide <span class="diff_off">radiation</span> <span class="diff_add">ideation</span> among the population or even suicide attempts. What really explains the difference in the United States across the populations is the number of guns. Because <span class="diff_off">of</span> <span class="diff_add">it's</span> gun <span class="diff_off">suicides</span> <span class="diff_add">suicide</span> which is so different. </p><p class="linetext">And someone who commits suicide with a gun very likely would not have either attempted or succeeded if the gun were not available. For example, a 2013 Swiss study <span class="diff_alert">,</span> tracked men after the size of their army was cut in half, effectively <span class="diff_off">when</span> removing guns from half <span class="diff_off">of</span> that group<span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="the ">The </span>overall suicide rate went down<span class="diff_alert">,</span> and the <span class="diff_off">researcher</span> <span class="diff_add">researchers</span> estimated that only 22% of <span class="diff_add">all</span> the men who <span class="diff_off">would've</span> <span class="diff_add">would</span> <span class="diff_add">have</span> killed themselves with a gun if it had been available wound up committing the act by other means.
