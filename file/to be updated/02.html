                       <p class="linetext">We've been dealing with an epidemic in the United States related to opioids. </p><p class="linetext">Wilson Compton, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health. He spoke February 12th at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D. C. </p><p class="linetext">What we've seen is <span class="diff_add">that</span> the <span class="diff_off">increase</span> <span class="diff_add">increased</span> number of <span class="diff_off">prescription</span> <span class="diff_add">prescriptions</span> are driving <span class="diff_alert">,</span> the  <span class="diff_alert" title="non-medical">nonmedical</span> use of prescription drugs. </p><p class="linetext">Drugs that are prescribed to treat pain. </p><p class="linetext">So <span class="diff_off">there</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">there's</span> tremendous availability of prescriptions. There <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">are</span> some 260 million prescriptions written in each year for opioids<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="that's ">That's </span>not tablets, that's prescriptions. So <span class="diff_off">its</span> <span class="diff_add">it's</span> millions <span class="diff_add">and</span> millions of these <span class="diff_alert">,</span> and some of them are available for diversion and <span class="diff_off">used</span> <span class="diff_add">use</span> inappropriately. </p><p class="linetext"><span class="diff_add">Some</span> <span class="diff_add">of</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="The ">the </span>pain patients may become hooked<span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="or ">Or </span>their meds may find their <span class="diff_off">ways</span> <span class="diff_add">way</span> to friends or relatives who take them recreationally. Or <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_add">a</span> prescription opioid <span class="diff_off">users</span> <span class="diff_add">user</span> may transition to heroin. </p><p class="linetext">Heroin is just another opioid drug<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="So ">so </span>the brain doesn't distinguish <span class="diff_alert">,</span> whether it comes from a pharmacy or <span class="diff_off">it</span> <span class="diff_off">comes</span> from a street drug dealer. </p><p class="linetext">What's <span class="diff_off">being</span> <span class="diff_add">been</span> drawing the most public health attention <span class="diff_alert">,</span> is the overdose death rates related to prescription <span class="diff_off">of</span> opioids and heroin<span class="diff_alert">,</span> which have increased markedly over the last 15 years. Right now <span class="diff_alert">,</span> we see drug <span class="diff_off">overdose</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">overdoses</span> killing nearly 50,000 persons in a given year in the United States. </p><p class="linetext">What are we doing about this? <span class="diff_off">We</span> <span class="diff_off">are</span> <span class="diff_add">We're</span> focusing in three areas. We need to think about prevention <span class="diff_add">in</span> terms of reducing access to prescriptions as the ultimate upstream driver of this epidemic. We need to be thinking <span class="diff_add">in</span> terms <span class="diff_off">to</span> <span class="diff_add">of</span> saving lives acutely by providing greater access to the reversing <span class="diff_off">drugs</span><span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_add">drug</span> <span class="diff_add">-</span> this is <span class="diff_off">nalaoxone</span> <span class="diff_off">the</span> <span class="diff_add">naloxone</span> <span class="diff_add">-</span> <span class="diff_add">that</span> blocks <span class="diff_alert">,</span> the <span class="diff_off">impacts</span><span class="diff_add">impact</span>. So if <span class="diff_off">somebody</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_off">overdose</span> <span class="diff_add">somebody's</span> <span class="diff_add">overdosed</span> and <span class="diff_off">there</span> <span class="diff_off">are</span> <span class="diff_off">no</span> <span class="diff_add">they're</span> <span class="diff_add">not</span> breathing <span class="diff_alert">,</span> and I can get this medication to them quickly<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> I can resuscitate them. <span class="diff_off">I</span> <span class="diff_off">guess</span> <span class="diff_off">there</span> <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">That</span> <span class="diff_add">gives</span> <span class="diff_add">us</span> a chance to help them turn their lives around with <span class="diff_off">a</span> <span class="diff_add">the</span> third aspect<span class="diff_alert">,</span> which is greater access to effective treatment<span class="diff_alert">,</span> through <span class="diff_off">medication</span> <span class="diff_off">assistant</span> <span class="diff_add">medication-assisted</span> treatment. </p><p class="linetext">But we also think we need to come up with better approaches for treating pain. <span class="diff_off">Whether</span> <span class="diff_add">What</span> <span class="diff_add">are</span> non-medical approaches <span class="diff_alert">,</span> that might use brain stimulation techniques, for example, to treat pain<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_off">Whether</span> <span class="diff_alert">?</span> <span class="diff_add">What</span> <span class="diff_add">are</span> other medications that don't include the opioid <span class="diff_off">existence</span> <span class="diff_add">system</span> <span class="diff_add">that</span> might be useful<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">?</span> These are the kinds of advances that science can bring us so that we can turn around this overdose epidemic <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_off">They</span> <span class="diff_off">are</span> <span class="diff_add">that</span> right now shows tremendous <span class="diff_off">increase</span> <span class="diff_add">increases</span> each year.</p>
